# Koelooptiemanna Fonts

Previously distributed via http://home.zonnet.nl/koelooptiemanna/graphics.html
but those guys are gone..

So now you can download them [here](/Generated_Fonts/school.zip)

Do whatever you want with the fonts, but don't make money off of them!

# Take a good look at the font, there are several variations of some characters (w,v,y,x,a)
