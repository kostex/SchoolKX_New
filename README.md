There are now (2020) four variations:
- Paula (ZMLK Maaskei) Regular and Expanded (also a monospaced numbers only font is available for tables/math etc)
- Haasnoot (Boom Uitgevers Amsterdam) Regular and Expanded
- Miranda (Miranda Delsard) Regular and Expanded (also a monospaced numbers only font is available for tables/math etc)
- 2 completely recreated versions (one with proportional, one with monospaced numbers). I did not combine them in one font because too many problems occur with that on Windows platform/software.. sigh..

Take a good look at them to see the differences.
